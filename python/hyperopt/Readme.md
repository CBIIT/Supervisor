# EQPy-enabled Hyperopt #

Files:

* eqpy_hyperopt/ - eqpy_hyperopt python package
* tests/ - unit tests for eqpy_hyperopt

Run the tests from within the tests directory with

`python -m unittest test_hyperopt.py`

The python path needs to be set correctly first. That can be by sourcing settings.sh.
